# Online-Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe
An online multiplayer tic tac toe using express.js and socket.io. 

Online multiplayer fucntionality is being implemented.

Note: I am aware that there is a straightforward and simple way to check for the winning patterns since 3x3 is small enough but I wanted to implement it in a more dynamic way simply for the sake of exploring and learning.
